# Link Collector

Link Collector is a Java application that collects and filters interconnected links from a given URL. It scrapes links from the page, then recursively fetches only those links that belong to the same domain as the original URL.

## How It Works

1. **Input URL & Domain Extraction**  
   When you supply a URL (e.g., `http://www.example.com`), the application extracts the host part (i.e., `www.example.com`) and stores it as the original domain.

2. **Link Scraping & Filtering**  
   The application uses an asynchronous `LinkScrapper` service to fetch the page contents and applies a regular expression to extract all absolute URLs.
    - **Filtering:** Only URLs that match the original domain are queued for further processing. For example, if the original URL is from `www.example.com`, only links from that domain (like `http://www.example.com/about`) will be processed.

4. **Results**  
   After processing, all collected links are sorted and returned as a `CollectionResult`, which includes the original URL plus any interconnected same-domain links.

## Tested URLs

You can test the application using URLs such as:

- **Example 1:**  
  **URL:** `https://martinfowler.com/architecture/`  
  **Expected Outcome:**  
  Should return around 13 links
- **Example 2:**  
  **URL:** `https://ecosio.com/en/careers/`  
  **Expected Outcome:**  
    Should return around 336 links
